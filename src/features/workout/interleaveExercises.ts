/**
 * Round-robins a filtered exercise pool across muscle groups instead of
 * leaving it in raw insertion order, optionally weighting the round
 * toward a person's stated focus areas.
 *
 * Why this exists: `WORKOUT_EXERCISES` lists every exercise for one
 * muscle group in a single block before moving to the next (all glute
 * exercises together, then all hamstring exercises, etc). Any program
 * whose `targetGroups` spans more than one group — but especially one
 * with only two, like a glutes+hamstrings program — filters that block
 * order but doesn't reshuffle it. Chunking a blocked list into fixed-size
 * days then means whole days come out as a single muscle group purely
 * by data-ordering accident (e.g. Day A, B, and C are 100% glutes before
 * a hamstring exercise is ever reached), even though the program was
 * meant to train both. Interleaving first means every day-sized chunk
 * gets a proportional mix of each targeted group instead.
 *
 * `priorityGroups` (a person's `focusAreas` preference) pulls extra
 * exercises from those groups each round — twice as many as every other
 * group — so programs actually lean toward what someone said they care
 * about (e.g. more core/arms work) without ever dropping the other
 * groups a program covers to zero; every group still gets visited every
 * round, just in a different ratio.
