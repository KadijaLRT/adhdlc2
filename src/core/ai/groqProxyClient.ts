/**
 * Client-side entry point for every Groq call in the app. This never

 * See that file's header comment for why (EXPO_PUBLIC_* vars are
 * inlined into the client bundle and are not a safe place for a
 * secret key, even for a "personal use" app).
 *
 * EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL only needs to be set for the native
 * (iOS/Android) build, where there's no same-origin server to hit a
 * relative /api path against — it should point at the deployed web
 * origin (e.g. https://your-app.vercel.app). On web, a relative path
 * against the app's own origin is correct and the env var can be left
 * unset.
